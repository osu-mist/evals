prof-faculty-create-evals-instructions=<p>As a supervisor, you use this page to initiate the performance evaluation for your \
  professional faculty employees in EvalS. You do so by choosing a start month/year for the evaluation cycle, and clicking \
  on the "Create Evaluation" button.</p>\
  <p>Professional faculty evaluations are to be completed annually. Once you initiate the process, EvalS will create the \
  evaluation records annually based on the start month/year you choose. For example, if you choose Aug, 2014, EvalS will \
  create an evaluation record for Aug 01, 2014 to July 31, 2015 for each of your professional employees when you click the \
  button. At about July 2015, EvalS will create another record for Aug. 01, 2015 to July 31, 2016 for each of your \
  professional faculty employees.</p>\
  <p>Please choose a start month/year to mirror the planning and activity calendar of your business. HR has a general \
  guideline; your college and department may have their directions on the cycle start time as well. Please take those \
  into consideration.</p>
